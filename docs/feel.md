# Feel: numbers to calibrate against Boundless

Every value here was chosen as a sensible starting point, not measured from Boundless. Nathan (who plays it) checks each one in play and reports what is off; the fix is a one-line change.

## Movement (`bm-core/src/movement.rs`, `MoveConfig::default`)

| Value | Now | Check in Boundless |
|---|---|---|
| Walk speed | 4.6 blocks/s | Time a walk across a known distance |
| Sprint speed | 7.6 blocks/s | Same, sprinting |
| Jump height | about 1.45 blocks (velocity 8.7, gravity 26) | Can you jump onto a 1-block ledge? A 2-block one? |
| Gravity | 26 blocks/s² | Does falling feel floaty or heavy? |
| Ground acceleration | 55 blocks/s² (full speed in about 0.14 s) | Is starting and stopping instant or eased? |
| Air control | 14 blocks/s² | How much can you steer mid-jump? |
| Swim speed | 3.2 blocks/s | |
| Player size | 0.6 wide, collides 1.9 tall, drawn 2.0, eyes at 1.75 | **Set by Nathan (2026-10-18):** two blocks tall; nobody fits under less than two blocks. Height sliders in Boundless are visual only |
| Reach | 7 blocks (`ServerConfig::reach`) | How far away can you break a block? |

## World (`bm-server/src/config.rs`, `bm-worldgen`)

| Value | Now | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Planet width | 2 048 blocks around | How long to walk all the way round a small world? |
| Planet height | 384 blocks, sea level 128 | Deepest caves, tallest mountains |
| View radius | 10 chunks (320 blocks) | How far can you see terrain detail? |
| Edit rate | 12 per second, burst 24 | Fast building feel |

## Not built yet, but to measure while playing

- Break time by hand for soil, stone, wood; with a basic tool.
- Day length.
- How dark caves are without light.
